If you're looking to contribute to an extension, we've written up a handy
little guide that will be useful to you:

http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/codebase/dev/contributing-patches/

You do not need to clone this repository to produce new extensions. We just use
it as a placeholder for any production or sample extensions we create.

Please note that we do *not* accept pull requests! Instead, every patch must
go through a code review process on our own Review Board server at
http://reviews.reviewboard.org/.
